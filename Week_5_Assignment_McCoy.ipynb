    "- create a Python script/file/module with a function that takes a pandas dataframe as an input and returns the probability of churn for each row in the dataframe\n",

    "- use other autoML packages, such as TPOT, H2O, MLBox, etc, and compare performance and features with pycaret\n",
    "- create a class in your Python module to hold the functions that you created\n",
    "- accept user input to specify a file using a tool such as Python's `input()` function, the `click` package for command-line arguments, or a GUI\n",
    "- Use the unmodified churn data (new_unmodified_churn_data.csv) in your Python script. This will require adding the same preprocessing steps from week 2 since this data is like the original unmodified dataset from week 1."

    "Pycaret was installed so that we can use this libary to import the functions we will use. The next line we imported those functions. Using the variable automl, the setup function will have us pass the target variable to inform the function that we will not train against a feature. The best model for this data set is LDA, linear discriminant analysis with an accuracy of 79.72%. A new data frame was created to drop the churn column. Then, we saved the model. Pickle is used to save and load binary data. We used this to open a file with the name LDA_model.py, then opened it for writing. Then, a file was created. "
